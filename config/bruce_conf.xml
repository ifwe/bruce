             large compressed message sets, which will cause Bruce to discard

             unnecessarily restrict the size of a compressed message set.  As

             are as follows:

                 "perTopic": This setting will cause each topic not listed in
                     "topicConfigs" to be batched individually on a per-topic
                     basis, with the "config" attribute specifying a batching
                     configuration from "namedConfigs" above.

                 "combinedTopics": This setting will cause all topics not
                     listed in "topicConfigs" to be batched together in mixed
                     topic batches.  In this case, "config" must be either
                     missing or set to the empty string, and the batching
                     configuration is determined by the "combinedTopics"
                     element above.  This is the setting that most people will
                     want.

                 "disable": This setting will cause batching to be disabled for
                     all topics not listed in "topicConfigs".  In this case,
                     the "config" attribute is optional and ignored.  This
                     setting is strongly discouraged due to performance

                 setting is strongly discouraged due to performance
