# This script is invoked during the build.  It has three modes of operation:
#
#     Mode 1: Generate 'version.c'.  In this case, the script receives no
#         command-line arguments.  It reads the contents of 'version.c.in' from
#         standard input and writes the contents of 'version.c' to standard
#         output.  The output has the string "VERSION_GOES_HERE" replaced with
#         the actual version.
#
#     Mode 2: Verify that generated file is up to date.  In this case, the
#         script receives a single command-line argument specifying the
#         pathname of the generated file, which may not exist.  The script is
#         invoked at the start of the build, and attempts to read the file.  If
#         it exists, its contents are searched for Bruce's version string,
#         which is compared with the actual version.  If the version does not
#         match or can not be determined, the file is deleted.  This forces the
#         file to be regenerated with a correct version string later in the
#         build.
#
#     Mode 3: Write Bruce's version to standard output.  This is used for
#         creating the file 'version.txt' (see below) in the case where we are
#         building a tarball containing Bruce's source code.
#
# In the case where Bruce is being built from a tarball (for instance, when
# building an RPM package), we obtain the version from a file 'version.txt' in
# the root of the tree (where the SConstruct file lives).  In the case where we
# are building from a Git repository, the 'version.txt' file will be missing
# and we determine the version based on a tag stored in Git.
