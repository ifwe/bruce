## Creating a Pull Request

To contribute code, create a pull request as described
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).  Use the "fork
and pull" model for making contributions.  A quick summary of the process is as
follows:

1. Fork Bruce's GitHub repository.  To fork the repo, click the
[fork button](http://github.com/tagged/bruce/fork) on the
[GitHub](http://github.com) web interface.

2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

3. Make your code changes in your local repository.  Within your own forked and
cloned repository, you are free to handle the code however you wish. Fork it,
tag it, commit it.  "Whatever works best for you" is the right answer to
"What's the process?" when you're in your own local repository.

4. Push your changes to your cloned repository.  Once you like how your changes
are functioning in your locally cloned repo, it's time to
[push them back up](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) to
your forked repo on GitHub.

5. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
to the master branch of the bruce repository.
